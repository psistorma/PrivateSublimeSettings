# Scope Hunter 1.5.0

## Changes

- Tooltips are less verbose
- Tooltips are more compact
- Tooltips now generate images for color boxes
- CSS changes to tooltips
- Better control of tooltip content
- Dividers between multiselect scopes
- Added messages.

## Important!
Tooltips now only work on **3072**.  There were some changes in the Sublime API that Scope Hunter is now taking advantage of, so if you want tooltips to still look good, please upgrade Sublime to 3072 or disable tooltips.

There have also been some settings changes to give users even better control of the info shown:

- Discontinue `show_color_scheme_info` settings.
- Added `styling`, `selectors`, and `file_paths` options to show respective info.
- Remove `css_file` setting.  ScopeHunter now always uses either dark or light css depending on brightness of the user's color scheme.  So if you would like to change the tooltip theme, please override those in the settings file.
