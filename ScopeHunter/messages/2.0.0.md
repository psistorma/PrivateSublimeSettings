# ScopeHunter 2.0.0

## Changes
- Tooltip theme structure is now different.  If you are using a custom theme, please see http://facelessuser.github.io/ScopeHunter/usage/#customizing-tooltip-theme for more info.
- Tooltip themes are now configured by using the `tooltip_theme` option.  `css_dark_override` and `css_light_override` no longer do anything.
