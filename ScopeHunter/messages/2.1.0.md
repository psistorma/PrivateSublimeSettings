# ScopeHunter 2.1.0

## Changes

- Reduce redundant CSS classes
- Simplify CSS classes and standardize how I use them as I plan to use the same convention in other packages as well.

## Fixes

- Fix copy not working for certain scope attributes


## Important!
If you use custom tooltip themes, some CSS classes and usage have changed.  For more information on the new CSS classes, please read the documentation: [Customizing Tooltip Theme](http://facelessuser.github.io/ScopeHunter/usage/#customizing-tooltip-theme).
