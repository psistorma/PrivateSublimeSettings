Thank you for installing sublime-cpp11!


Installation
============
To use this package as the default, you must disable the built-in C++ package.

Under Preferences->Settings - User, add "C++" to the "ignored_packages" list:
	"ignored_packages":
	[
		"C++"
	],


C/H Extensions
==============
By default this package allows a separate C language definition to associate
with .c/.h files.

To use sublime-cpp11 for these extensions, open the user preferences:

 	Preferences->Package Settings->C++11->Settings - User

and add the following:

	{
		"extensions": ["C", "H"]
	}


Note: The current version is an early release with only minimal support
